## Overview

Managed JScript was Microsoft's ECMAScript 3 implementation on the Dynamic Language Runtime, announced at MIX07 and shipped in the Silverlight 1.1 Alpha. It gave JavaScript developers CLR/DLR hosting, cross-language interop, and a browser-plugin sandbox.

## Code

```javascript
// Managed JScript (Silverlight DLR): dynamic code over CLR objects.
import System;
import System.Windows.Browser;

var page = HtmlPage.Document;
var outEl = page.getElementById("output");

function greet() {
    // Dynamic typing the whole way down; DLR interops with C#/Ruby/VB.
    outEl.innerHTML = "hello from Managed JScript";
}
```

Caption: paraphrased from the documented Silverlight QuickStart model — `HtmlPage` bridges to the browser; the engine runs CoreCLR inside the plugin sandbox.

## Distinctive traits

- DLR-native: shares the dynamic type system and hosting model with IronPython/IronRuby, not Active Scripting.
- Distinct product line from JScript .NET: no typed variables, no JScript.NET classes, no assembly generation.
- Browser-sandboxed via Silverlight's CoreCLR — managed code execution inside a web plugin.

## Status

Historical: Silverlight itself was deprecated (end of support 2021) and the DLR-JavaScript line never shipped beyond alpha-era releases; Microsoft abandoned Managed JScript plans by August 2009 per the DLR history.
