## Overview

WMLScript is the scripting companion to Wireless Markup Language in the Wireless Application Protocol — browser scripting for early mobile phones. Its ECMAScript-derived syntax was compiled to compact [bytecode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Bytecode) for low-bandwidth links.

## Code

```javascript
// WMLScript (.wmls): functions only — no objects, no arrays.
extern function validateForm(zip) {
  if (String.length(zip) != 5) {
    Dialogs.alert("ZIP must be 5 digits");
    return false;
  }
  WMLBrowser.setVar("z", zip);
  WMLBrowser.refresh();        // push the card to the display
  return true;
}
```

Caption: `extern` exports the function for WML `<a>` invocation; `WMLBrowser`/`Dialogs` are standard libraries, replacing the DOM-style host objects of web JavaScript.

## Distinctive traits

- Function-only core: no objects, no arrays — ECMAScript syntax pruned to procedures and primitives.
- Built-in standard libraries (Lang, Float, String, URL, WMLBrowser, Dialogs) supply every host capability.
- Compiled to bytecode ahead of transfer on tight wireless links, then interpreted on the handset VM.
- Split with JavaScript: source files (.wmls) are separate from WML decks; cards call functions by URL anchor.

## Status

Historical: launched with WAP 1.x (April 1998), consolidated spec WAP-193 in 2001. The WAP stack itself lost to XHTML/basic browser stacks in the mid-2000s; WMLScript had no successor lineage.
