## Overview

Mascara was a translator that extended JavaScript with the abandoned ECMAScript 4 draft's features — classes, namespaces, and optional type checking — while compiling to plain browser JavaScript. It anticipated what [TypeScript](/languages/typescript) later shipped at scale.

## Code

::code-group

```typescript [abstractions]
// ES4-flavored Mascara syntax: type annotations compile away entirely.
class Greeter {
  var name: string;
  function Greeter(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  function greet(): string {
    return "Hello, " + this.name;
  }
}

var g: Greeter = new Greeter("world");
alert(g.greet());
```

::

Caption: paraphrased from the site's ES4 sample structure — classes and annotations are Mascara syntax; below the translator this is prototype-based ES3 JavaScript.

## Distinctive traits

- Optional type-checking: static checks "with erasure", per the author — annotations erase in translation, so plain JavaScript stays valid input.
- ES4 feature carrier: classes and namespaces reached working JS years before ES2015 standardized them.
- The translator was a Python program running server-side; the demo hosted on Google App Engine.

## Status

Historical and dormant: Mascara 1.0 shipped in 2009 as a commercial product; the site stopped updating soon after. Ecma abandoned ES4 in 2008 — weeks after Mascara's first release — removing its founding premise.

## History

Version 0.1 was downloadable by June 6, 2008 (first successful homepage capture), announced by Kjær on the es-discuss list three days later — itself years after the project began against the obsolete Netscape ES4 draft. Ecma abandoned ES4 weeks after; Mascara 1.0 still shipped commercially in 2009.
