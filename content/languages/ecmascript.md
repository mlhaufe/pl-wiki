## Overview

ECMAScript is the language standard that scripting engines implement: [JavaScript](/languages/javascript) is Netscape's branding, JScript Microsoft's. The specification is developed by Ecma TC39 in the open and kept current at the TC39 site.

## Code

```javascript
// Same core everywhere: an edition's features are what engines converge on.
const langs = ["Mocha", "LiveScript", "JScript"];
const tagged = langs.map((s) => ({ name: s, len: s.length }));
// Optional chaining + nullish coalescing (ES2020), a spec-level example:
const engine = tagged.at(-1)?.name ?? "none";
```

Caption: the shared core — anything valid here runs on any conforming engine (V8, SpiderMonkey, JavaScriptCore); branding lives in hosts and engines, not in the spec'd language.

## Distinctive traits

- Defines the core: syntax, types, prototype mechanism, built-ins — hosts inject the rest (DOM, Node APIs).
- Yearly cadence via TC39's staged process (0–4); engines implement proposals at stage 3–4, before publication.
- Edition history is load-bearing: ES1 1997, ES3 1999, ES5 2009, ES2015; the 4th edition was abandoned in 2008.
- "ECMAScript" and "JavaScript" name the same core language; dialects differ in engine extensions and host objects.

## Status

Active: the 17th edition (ECMAScript 2026) was published June 2026; drafts live at tc39.es. Implemented by V8, SpiderMonkey, JavaScriptCore, QuickJS, Hermes, and other engines.

## History

Netscape submitted JavaScript for standardization in November 1996; the first edition was adopted June 1997, based on joint Microsoft/Netscape submissions. The ambitious fourth edition stalled and was dropped in 2008 in favor of the Harmony process that produced ES5 and the yearly cadence since.
