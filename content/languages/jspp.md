## Overview

JS++ extends [JavaScript](/languages/javascript) with an optional type system whose declared types are guaranteed to hold at runtime — sound gradual typing for untyped-library interop. Compilation erases types and emits JavaScript, keeping deployment identical.

## Code

::code-group

```javascript [combinations]
import System;

external jQuery, $;               // one-line JS-library import

var offset = 0;                   // untyped: stays plain JavaScript

unsigned int pageHeight = $(document).height(); // guaranteed unsigned int

int[] rgb = [ 0xFF, 0xFA, 0xFF ]; // 32-bit ints, not doubles

int plus(int a, int b) {          // overloading needs types
    return a + b;
}
```

::

Caption: `external` imports stay JavaScript-dynamic; annotated variables keep their types at runtime — annotations erase, guarantees compile in.

## Distinctive traits

- Unified External Type walls JavaScript's dynamics out of the checked region — no `any` contaminating soundness.
- Guaranteed types: annotated values hold at runtime (patented approach), unlike erasure-only gradual systems.
- Real integer types (8–64-bit, signed/unsigned) over JavaScript's single double, with `int+` existent types preventing out-of-bounds accesses at compile time.
- Nominal classes compile statically; no ASI — semicolons are required, so brace style is free.

## Status

Dormant: first release October 2011, modern implementation beta May 31 2016, stable reached 0.10.0 (December 2021) under a BSD license; compiler in C/C++ for Windows/macOS/Linux with no new release since.
