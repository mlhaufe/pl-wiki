## Overview

ActionScript is the ECMAScript-dialect language of the Adobe Flash platform, designed by Gary Grossman for interactivity in Flash Player. Version 3.0 was a full reworking: classes, runtime type checking, and a new JIT virtual machine.

## Code

```actionscript
package org.wikipedia.example {
  import flash.display.Sprite;
  import flash.text.TextField;

  public class Greeter extends Sprite {
    public function Greeter() {
      var txtHello:TextField = new TextField();
      txtHello.text = "Hello World";
      this.addChild(txtHello);
    }
  }
}
```

Caption: class-based AS3 style — the Sprite is the display root, and `addChild` places the text field on the display list.

## Distinctive traits

- ECMAScript dialect with a Java-style classical class model, unlike JavaScript's prototype object model.
- Types survive to runtime (AVM2 checks and exploits them for native representation), rather than erasing like ECMAScript.
- E4X (ECMA-357) made XML a native data type with fluent navigation.
- Sealed vs `dynamic` classes: fixed shapes compile tighter; dynamic shells accept ad-hoc properties.

## Status

Historical: Flash Player was deprecated in 2017 and discontinued at end of 2020. The spec stayed freely offered; Apache Flex is the open-source AS3 compiler, Tamarin/AVM2 sources are Mozilla-hosted, and Apache Royale cross-compiles AS3 to JavaScript.
