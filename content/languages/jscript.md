## Overview

JScript is Microsoft's ECMAScript dialect, first shipped in Internet Explorer 3.0 (August 1996) as an Active Scripting engine. The name dodged the Sun JavaScript trademark; per Crockford, the languages were then the same core.

## Code

::code-group

```javascript [idioms]
// JScript's signature extension: conditional compilation in block comments.
/*@cc_on
  @if (@_jscript_version >= 5)
    WScript.Echo("JScript 5+ on Windows Script Host");
  @else
    WScript.Echo("older engine");
  @end
@*/

// Otherwise textbook ES3: prototype-linked objects, first-class functions.
function Counter() { this.count = 0; }
Counter.prototype.tick = function () { return ++this.count; };
```

::

Caption: the `@cc_on` block is JScript-only (unsupported by other engines); everything after is the shared ECMAScript core.

## Distinctive traits

- Active Scripting engine: same core plugs into IE, classic ASP, Windows Script Host, and COM hosts.
- Conditional compilation (`@cc_on`, `@if`) extended ECMA-262 — a dialect marker other engines never adopted.
- JScript 3.0 (June 1997) was, per Microsoft, the first scripting language fully conforming to ECMA-262.
- Later splits never went mainstream: JScript .NET (ES4-flavored, CLI) and Managed JScript (DLR) both died.

## Status

Historical: last classic version is 5.8 (IE8); IE9+ used the separate "Chakra" engine (JScript 9.0, 2011). Microsoft deprecated and offered disabling JScript in IE; Windows hosts still carry the 5.x engine.
