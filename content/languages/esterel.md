## Overview

Esterel is a synchronous imperative language for reactive systems. It replaces physical time with logical instants, making concurrency deterministic by construction and programs amenable to formal verification.

## Code

```esterel
signal S, T;
loop
  every 10 do
    emit Alarm
  end every
  abort await S until T;
  emit O;
end loop
```

Paraphrased sketch: preemption and broadcast in one shape — `abort ... until T` discards the wait mid-instant when `T` arrives; `every 10` raises a tick-counted cycle; communication is instantaneous within a single tick.

## Distinctive traits

- Multiform time: programs see instants, not seconds — deterministic scheduling by construction.
- Broadcast signals: present-or-absent communication, instantaneous within a single tick.
- Preemption is first-class: `suspend`, `await`, and `abort` are core constructs, not libraries.
- Dual targets: compilers generate both C and RTL hardware descriptions (VHDL/Verilog).

## Status

Industrialized in the SCADE suite for safety-critical avionics; the IEEE P1778 standardization attempt dissolved in 2011. The open-source Columbia Esterel Compiler and a Racket implementation exist; commercial lineage via Esterel Technologies.
