## Overview

JavaScript is the scripting language of the web: engines execute it in every major browser, and hosts like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) carry it onto servers. Loosely typed and prototype-based, it is standardized by Ecma TC39 as ECMAScript (ECMA-262).

## Code

::code-group

```javascript [primitives]
// literals construct; operators consume.
let year = 1995;
let name = "Mocha";
year + 8;          // 2003
name + " → JavaScript"; // "Mocha → JavaScript"
```

```javascript [combinations]
// objects/arrays compose; destructuring consumes.
const lang = { name: "Mocha", year: 1995 };
const { name } = lang;
const [first] = ["LiveScript", "JavaScript"];
```

```javascript [abstractions]
// define and apply units — closures and classes.
const makeCounter = (start) => {
  let n = start;
  return () => n += 1;
};
const tick = makeCounter(10);
tick(); // 11

class Counter {                     // ES2015 classes are the modern face...
  count = 0;
  increment() { return ++this.count; }
}
```

```javascript [idioms]
// prototype delegation — the mechanism classes compile to.
const Proto = {
  count: 0,
  increment() { return ++this.count; }
};
const widget = Object.create(Proto);
widget.increment(); // 1
```

::

Caption: one tab per tour slot — literals with operators; composition via
destructuring; closures *and* classes as definable units; prototype
delegation as the community idiom, which is exactly what `class` compiles
to.

## Distinctive traits

- Prototype-based objects: inheritance by delegation instead of class declarations; objects are open, expandable property bags.
- First-class functions and closures carry the Scheme lineage; they underpin callbacks, modules, and the async ecosystem.
- Loose dynamic typing: nothing declared, object references checked at runtime; type mismatches surface late.
- Garbage-collected automatically; V8's Orinoco collector is generational and moving, tuned to keep pauses short.
- Host environments inject their object models: browsers reflect the DOM into JS; Node.js hosts server-side code.

## Status

Active and standardizing briskly: ECMAScript 2026 (17th edition) published June 2026, with yearly releases and public development on Ecma TC39. Main engines: V8 (Chrome, Node.js), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (Safari).

## History

Prototype (Mocha) built in ten days in May 1995; shipped as LiveScript in the Navigator 2.0 beta, then renamed JavaScript after a Sun trademark agreement in December 1995 — the name from marketing, the semantics from Scheme and [Self](/languages/self). ECMA-262 first edition followed in 1997; the stalled ES4 was abandoned in 2008 for Harmony's yearly editions.
