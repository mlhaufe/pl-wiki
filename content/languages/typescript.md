## Overview

TypeScript is Microsoft's typed superset of [JavaScript](/languages/javascript), designed to make JavaScript-scale development maintainable. The compiler erases types — the emitted code is ordinary JavaScript — so adoption is gradual rather than all-or-nothing.

## Code

```typescript
interface Greeter {
  greet(name: string): string;
}

const formal: Greeter = {
  greet: (name) => `Hello, ${name}.`,
};

// Generics tie input and output types together (array.map keeps T -> U):
const lengths: number[] = ["Mocha", "LiveScript"].map((s) => s.length);

// Enums give names to finite constants:
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }
const pick: Color = Color.Green;
```

Caption: structural typing accepts `formal` without a class; every annotation here is erased — the output is idiomatic ES JavaScript.

## Distinctive traits

- Structural type system: shapes match by members, not declarations; annotations are optional and inferred liberally.
- Types are entirely erased: TypeScript runs wherever JavaScript runs, with no runtime of its own.
- Contracts scale via interfaces, generics, and declaration merging (growing `Array<T>`, DOM typings).
- Aligned with ES evolution: its class and module syntax preceded ES2015's, then converged with it.

## Status

Active and dominant for new web/server projects: developed openly on GitHub under the Apache-2.0 license; Microsoft ships the compiler and VS tooling. 0.9 (2013) added generics, 1.0 arrived 2014, and releases stay yearly.

## History

Announced October 1, 2012, by Somasegar's division with an early preview, a specification, and the compiler source on CodePlex; Anders Hejlsberg (C#'s lead) drove the design. TypeScript 0.9 (2013) introduced generics and a re-engineered compiler ahead of 1.0.
