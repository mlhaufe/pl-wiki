## Overview

Koru is an event continuation/effect language for uncompromising systems
programming, billed as "The Continuation Language". Its core abstraction is
the `tor` (renamed from `event` in July 2026): a unit that declares its
named exits up front, and every caller must handle each one — no hidden
exceptions, and partial handling is a compile error.

## Code

```koru
import std/io

tor greet { name: string } -> string     // tor: typed input record + result
greet
-> "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"              // expression body

greet (name: "World"): msg |>            // invoke; |> opens outcome handling
std/io:print.ln(msg)                     // msg bound by punning
```

Caption: abstractions: the `tor` is the definable unit — declared exits
force every caller into a handler chain; invocation *is* control flow
(consuming the successful branch binds `msg`).

## Distinctive traits

- Tor + mandatory outcome arms: callers handle every named exit; partial
  handling is a compile error — outcomes are control flow, not values.
- Phantom obligations: the `!` suffix mints a compile-time obligation
  (`string<connected!>`), a `<!state>` param discharges it — resource
  protocols, taint tracking, and units of measure at zero runtime cost.
- Impurity tracked transitively across the call graph; host code (syscalls,
  C libraries, FFI) confined to a typed `proc` escape hatch.
- No runtime, no GC: ~4.8 KB static hello-world ELF; native/JS/C# emitters,
  playground running the full pipeline client-side via WASM.
- Comptime metaprogramming through typed `ProgramAST`/`Source` parameters;
  templates rather than macros; self-hostable compiler pipeline.

## Status

Pre-release v0.1.x (npm-installable, MIT); compiler self-hosts in Zig and
emits native (Zig), JavaScript, and C# backends. Benchmarks are prominent
self-claims (sieve vs Rust, Orisha nginx) from the project itself.
