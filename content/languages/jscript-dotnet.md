## Overview

JScript .NET was Microsoft's 2002 CLI reworking of [JScript](/languages/jscript), developed in conjunction with the (later abandoned) ECMAScript Edition 4. It kept classic dynamics — typeless variables, `eval`, expando classes — while adding ES4-style classes and optional strong types.

## Code

```javascript
// JScript .NET: typeless script style and optional strong typing coexist.
import System;

var untyped = 1;                 // typeless, like classic JScript
var typed: int = 2;              // strong type, compile-time checked
typed = 3;                       // fine
// typed = "abc";                // compile error

// ES4-flavored classes with inheritance:
class Greeter {
  var name: String;
  function Greeter(name: String) { this.name = name; }
  function greet(): String { return "Hello, " + this.name; }
}

Console.WriteLine(new Greeter("world").greet());
```

Caption: annotations check at compile time but the runtime stays dynamic — an early, CLR-bound take on the same gradualness [TypeScript](/languages/typescript) later made portable.

## Distinctive traits

- True compiled .NET language: sources compiled to Common Intermediate Language, not engine-interpreted script.
- Dual-mode typing: typeless `var` scripting or strongly typed declarations, mixing freely in one file.
- ES4-era features reached production here first: classes with inheritance, overloading, packages.
- Excluded from the Visual Studio IDE's first-class designer support; positioned as a classic-ASP upgrade path.

## Status

Historical: shipped with .NET/Visual Studio 2002, effectively dead after that generation. Unlike Managed JScript (DLR), it targeted the CLI proper — but neither line outlived the 2000s.
