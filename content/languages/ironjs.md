## Overview

IronJS embedded a JavaScript runtime in .NET applications: an [ECMAScript](/languages/ecmascript) 3 implementation on Microsoft's Dynamic Language Runtime. Named for the IronPython/IronRuby tradition, it was an independent project — Microsoft had dropped its own Managed JScript.

## Code

```csharp
// Embedding IronJS in a .NET app: a hosted ES3 runtime.
var runtime = new IronJS.Hosting.CSharp.Context();
runtime.Execute("var counter = 0;");
runtime.Execute("function tick() { counter += 1; return counter; }");

object result = runtime.Execute("tick();");
Console.WriteLine(result); // 1
```

Caption: paraphrased from the documented hosting model — the `Context` object embeds the engine; ES3 code runs against CLR objects through the DLR.

## Distinctive traits

- DLR-based embedding: JavaScript ran as a dynamic CLR citizen inside arbitrary .NET hosts.
- Compiled ES3 to DLR expression trees — bytecode on CLR2/CLR4 and Mono, not interpreted line-by-line.
- Ran jQuery 1.4 within months of its first announcement — real-world DOM library compatibility as a goal.

## Status

Historical: no commits since ~2013; the repository went read-only (archived January 2025). Apache-2.0 licensed; the ECMA3 conformance suite and Sputnik test runner came from contributor John Gietzen.
