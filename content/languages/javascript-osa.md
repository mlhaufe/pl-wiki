## Overview

JavaScript OSA plugged [JavaScript](/languages/javascript) — Mozilla's SpiderMonkey core — into the Mac's Open Scripting Architecture as a freeware AppleScript alternative by Late Night Software. Scripts spoke to applications through Apple events instead of a browser DOM.

## Code

```javascript
// JavaScript OSA: host objects bind to Mac applications via Apple events.
const Finder = MacOS.app("Finder");

const disk = Finder.disks.byName("Macintosh HD");
disk.desktopPosition = { x: 100, y: 40 };

// AppleScript-style targets, JavaScript syntax:
const name = Finder.name;

console.log("Frontmost app: " + MacOS.frontmost.name);
```

Caption: paraphrased from the documented Core/MacOS object model — application objects arrive as Apple-event bindings; the core language is stock SpiderMonkey JavaScript.

## Distinctive traits

- Host objects, not a browser: `Core` and `MacOS` objects wrap Apple events; no DOM anywhere.
- Same core language as Netscape's engine — JS semantics with none of the web platform.
- Script Debugger integration: bundled with the flagship editor; scriptable like any OSA component.

## Status

Historical: released 2001, an alpha second version (2005) bundled with Script Debugger 4, then dropped from Script Debugger 5 in 2012 for lack of interest. Apple's JavaScript for Automation (JXA, 2014) later took the JavaScript-scripting niche system-wide.
